# 👋 Hey there! I'm FrankStrix

Welcome to my digital playground! 🚀 Here's a little about me:

## 🏀 Passion for Basketball  
On or off the court, basketball is my game. Whether it's perfecting a fadeaway or analyzing the best plays, you'll find me diving deep into the sport I love. 

## 🎵 Hip-Hop Beats  
From classic boom-bap to modern trap vibes, hip-hop fuels my creative flow. Music isn't just a hobby; it's a rhythm that keeps me coding and hooping.

## 💻 Coding & GNU/Linux Enthusiast  
I love building and breaking things in code. Whether it's a side project, open-source contribution, or exploring new tools, you'll catch me writing scripts and spinning up configurations in **NixOS** – because declarative and reproducible systems are 🔥. 

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C/C++, HTML and CSS (SASS also), Java, React (dabbling ✨)
- **Tools**: NixOS, Neovim, Git, Docker, Zed, Intellij IDEA
- **Hobbies in Tech**: Writing efficient code, exploring open-source projects, and creating cool stuff!

### 🌟 Fun Projects I'm Proud Of:
